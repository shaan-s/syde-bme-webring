# Overview
A [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) for SYDE and BME students from the University of Waterloo. Open to all current and past students, as well as faculty. Webrings were a popular way to link websites in the '90s, meant to increase traffic and discoverability, especially among personal/amateur websites. This webring links sites in a circular way, providing links on each site to traverse to the next and previous site.
